Apple Analysis ETL Pipeline
Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to analyze Apple product purchase data. The pipeline consists of two primary workflows:

Customers who bought AirpodsAfterIphone
Customers who bought onlyAirpodsAndIphone
The pipeline extracts data from various file types, transforms it, and loads the results into a Delta Lake table on DBFS.

Components

reader_factory.py: Handles file type detection and creates appropriate reader instances.
extractor.py: Extracts data from files using the reader_factory.
transformer.py: Transforms extracted data as required.
loader_factory.py: Determines the target file format (e.g., Delta Lake) and creates loader instances.
loader.py: Loads transformed data into the target location (e.g., DBFS).
apple_analysis.py: Orchestrates the ETL pipeline, defining the two workflows and their respective logic.
Workflows

Customers who bought AirpodsAfterIphone:
Extracts relevant data from files.
Transforms data to identify customers who purchased Airpods after buying an iPhone.
Loads the transformed data into a Delta Lake table.
Customers who bought onlyAirpodsAndIphone:
Extracts relevant data from files.
Transforms data to identify customers who purchased only Airpods and iPhones.
Loads the transformed data into a Delta Lake table.
Dependencies

Specify required Python libraries and versions (e.g., pandas, PySpark, Delta Lake, etc.)
Usage

Provide instructions on how to run the pipeline, including any necessary environment setup or configuration.
Explain how to modify the pipeline for different data sources or output formats.
Additional Information

Consider adding sections for project goals, data sources, expected outputs, and any specific requirements.
Include details about error handling and logging mechanisms.
Provide information on testing and deployment procedures.
Offer contact information or support resources.
Best Practices

Use clear and concise language.
Structure the README logically, with headings and subheadings.
Consider adding diagrams or flowcharts to visualize the pipeline.
Keep the README updated as the project evolves.
By following these guidelines, you can create a comprehensive README file that effectively communicates the project's purpose, structure, and usage to other developers and stakeholders.

Remember to replace placeholders with specific details about your project.

Would you like to add more details to your README, such as specific technologies used, data sources, or expected outputs?
